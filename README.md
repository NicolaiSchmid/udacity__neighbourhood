## Neighbourhood map
Hey, this is a simple React project for a Udacity ND.

To start it in development mode install all dependencies `yarn install` and run `yarn start`.


To build a production version with a ServiceWorker run `yarn build`. Now the created `build/` directory can be deployed to a server or tested locally, for example with a python (v2.7) webserver `cd build && python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.

Please enjoy!
